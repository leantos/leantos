# Refactored README for SRE/DBRE Roles

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the competencies and technologies relevant to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and Database Reliability Engineering (DBRE) roles at EU-based organizations. Emphasizing our commitment to robust infrastructure, we detail our XOS Infra V2 architecture and the approaches for ensuring high availability of our PostgreSQL implementations.

## Role Context
As the demand for SRE and DBRE professionals continues to rise in Europe, our focus is on creating resilient, scalable systems and improving the reliability of database operations. This requires a deep understanding of cloud technologies, container orchestration, and a proactive approach to infrastructure management.

## XOS Infra V2 Architecture
The XOS Infra V2 architecture leverages modern cloud-native principles to deliver scalable and resilient application infrastructures. Key components of this architecture include:
- **Microservices**: Designed to operate independently, allowing for better scaling and fault isolation.
- **Containerization**: Utilizing Docker and Kubernetes for efficient resource management and deployment.
- **Load Balancing**: Ensuring traffic is effectively routed to instances across our microservices.

## PostgreSQL HA Implementation
For high availability (HA) of our PostgreSQL databases, we implement:
- **Replication**: Utilizing both streaming and logical replication for data redundancy.
- **Failover Mechanisms**: Automated detection and failover to ensure minimal downtime.
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability metrics to track performance and reliability.

## DR Console TUI
Our Disaster Recovery Console (DR Console) provides a Text User Interface (TUI) for streamlined management of recovery operations, enhancing user experience and operational efficiency during critical incidents.

## Observability Metrics
Monitoring and observability are key to maintaining system reliability. We gather metrics related to:
- **System Performance**: CPU, RAM, and I/O usage statistics.
- **Application Health**: Error rates, response times, and throughput monitoring.
- **Database Performance**: Query performance, locking behavior, and connection management.

## EU Relocation Goals
We are actively pursuing opportunities that align with our future growth within the EU. Our goal is to provide a supportive environment for professionals looking to relocate, ensuring smooth transitions and compliance with local regulations.

## Existing Technologies and Languages
We maintain expertise in diverse technologies, including but not limited to:
- **Languages**: Python, Go, Java
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
- **Tools**: Terraform, Ansible, Prometheus

## Personal Details
We value individual contributions and unique backgrounds that enhance our team's diversity. Each team member brings distinct experiences that contribute to our collaborative success.
